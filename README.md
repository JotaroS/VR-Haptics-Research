## My two-cents

With the emerge of recent VR haptic technologies, a personal necessity of building a VR haptics research repository came up.
Actuators, linkages, vibrotactiles. Lots of VR haptics are proposed for variety of _unique_ sensation. Some for _variety_ of application scenario. Some for _specific_ situation. But all of them for a solemn ambition of VR haptics: immersion through the sense of presense of matter.

VR haptics, where it will lead? Maybe for scientific interest for haptic sensation, or for playing VR games but with a bit of more excitement. Great, but how it will lead to every Player-Ones? Does these papers help? I needed some sort of _Scuola di Atene_ for that.

With a great thanks to all researchers over the world with their cool projects,
